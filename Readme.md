# Django Social Clone Website

## About

This project is being done to learn how to use class based views (CBVs) in django. If you wish to view the code or the project then you can simply follow the install instructions and launch the site to view it.

## Install Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment using virtualenv and activate it. (I am assuming you are familiar with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and you also have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
2. Create a folder in the virtualenv and change to that directory using the terminal
```
    mkdir src
    cd src
```
3. Clone the git repo using the following command
```
    git clone https://github.com/Jaydaar/social_clone.git
```
4. Install the requirements from the 'requirements.txt' file. (This file will be kept as up to date as possible)
```
    cd social_clone
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Change into the mysocial directory and run the server
```
    cd mysocial
    python manage.py runserver
```

You should now have the project running. Let me know if you have any problems.
